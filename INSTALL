Generic Instructions:
---------------------

Installation:

You can install PiSi on your system with a single command.

# ./setup.py install

If you are on a Pardus system, you should delete /usr/lib/pardus/pisi
when you are installing the SVN version

PiSi requires piksemel XML processing library, the newest version
Berkekey DB python bindings called "bsddb3" and Pardus configuration 
manager COMAR in order to run.

If you are upgrading from an old PiSi release you may have to 
run the following command as root:

# pisi rebuild-db

For testing, please read tests/README


OS X Instructions:
------------------

Install homebrew from https://brew.sh, and then 

$ brew install python

$ pip install bsddb3

Install piksemel XML processing library

$ brew install coreutils xz gnupg2

set up gnupg2 if needed:

$ gpg --gen-key

$ ./setup.py install

$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/pisi-cli /usr/local/bin/pisi

It should work on a current OS X installation.
